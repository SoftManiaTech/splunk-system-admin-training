useradd splunk

groupadd splunk

```
Create directory

mkdir /opt/splunk
```

Change the ownership of the created directory to the new user **"splunk"** (hereafter will be called as splunk user)

```

## Step-3 : Splunk Enterprise Installation

Switch to splunk user 
```bash
sudo su - splunk
```

Navigate to splunk user home directory
```bash
cd /home/splunk
```

Download Splunk (Based on the version you want, you can get this command from https://www.splunk.com/en_us/download/splunk-enterprise/thank-you-enterprise.html)
```bash
wget -O splunk-9.0.1-82c987350fde-Linux-x86_64.tgz "https://download.splunk.com/products/splunk/releases/9.0.1/linux/splunk-9.0.1-82c987350fde-Linux-x86_64.tgz"
